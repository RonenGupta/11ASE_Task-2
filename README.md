# Year 11 Accelerated Software Engineering Assessment Task 2 FPS Game - Sprint 4

### Author

## Features

- Main Menu: Choose between 4 choices, Survival, Free Play, View the Tutorial, or exit the game.
- Survival Mode: Standard survival FPS gameplay with grotesque enemies and a secret finale. Survive for as long as you can!
- Free Play Mode: Try spawning enemies of your own and try between 3 guns!
- Tutorial: View the controls for the gamemodes.
- Exit: Exit the game.

- Note: Do not press Shift and Q together as it triggers an unknown error in Ursina Engine, making the game crash midway. I have researched this flaw for a long time and also checked with peers using Ursina Engine, however they face the game issue as well. For the sake of the gameplay, do not press Shift and Q together :(
